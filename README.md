## Environment Variables

For security, this application uses server-side environment variables that are NOT exposed to the client. When deploying to Vercel, set these variables in your project settings:

```bash
# Required for Vapi AI integration
VAPI_ASSISTANT_ID=your_vapi_assistant_id
VAPI_PUBLIC_API_KEY=your_vapi_public_api_key
AGENT_NAME="YallaTalk Assistant"
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Never use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for sensitive API keys as they will be exposed to the client-side bundle and visible to users.

```bash
npm install
